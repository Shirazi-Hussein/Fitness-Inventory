After COVID hit and gyms closed, it left people without any effective way to weightlift for months to come. Everyone flocked to online retailers and bought their stocks of weight
plates and barbells, turning fitness into a rat race of who can stay up at 2am and checkout on a new set of bumper plates the fastest. With multiple retailers and different types
of plates, it was a toll to finally find some gym equipment that was both affordable and in stock. I decided to settle the problem myself by data scraping several of the most
popular retailers and displaying only the products that are on sale right now. I brought up the website to a few fitness forums like r/Homegyms, which was recieved warmly.
